Motion of the Day: An iOS App by Gabriel Saucedo

My first iOS app that is live on the App Store!

Looking to add more movement to your day? Motion of the Day is your simple solution to stay active with minimal effort! Whether youâ€™re at home, at work, or on the go, our app offers a daily stretch or exercise at the tap of a button.

I began this project because I was eager to see the ins and outs of app development, and I especially wanted to dip my feet into programming using Swift. After learning how Swift works and how it works inside XCode, I was able to begin on my first app development project, and I sure learned a lot. From splash screens to testing, and from submitting for review to ready for distribution, I was able to experience the full procedure that developing and releasing an app had to offer.

Every line of code and asset used within the app (assets were not added to this repository as there was a lot), was coded, drawn, or created by me. 

Upon completion of this project, I learned the FULL scope of what it takes to put an app on the App Store, along with insight on overcoming various obstacles that I encountered throughout the app development and shipping process. Including learning about the legal stuff!

I'd like to say that upon completion, it felt like a mini-internship, where I can take what I learned here and use this experience in future endeavors.
